                        <h3>Kenneth Odoh - Data Visualization in Python/ Django</h3>
                        <p>
                            Data Visualization is a very important aspect of descriptive statistics. Imagine a situation when a business manager wants to know the amount of sales made for the day. He can get his problem solved in two ways. One of them is by showing the manager a descriptive log of the daily statistics, while this could be helpful to a statistician, it may make no sense to the business manager.

The other way is use charts. We all know that a picture speaks clearer than sound. The statistical data becomes very clear when they are displayed in charts.

The talk will show how to create this charts and display them in a Django application.

This talk will show how to get the data to be represented in a chart. Using a scheduler to call an event that creates and loads the data in a database. We can now process the data transparently from the database.

                        <p>
                            MongoDB - from "humongous" - is an open source, non-relational, document-oriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of databases (Notably joins and transactions) in order to Achieve much better performance, MongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web development. The goal of the project is MongoDB to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which queries Provide rich and deep functionality).

This talk will introduce the rich feature set of mongoDB and examine how easy it is to develop with using python. We’ll discuss the various ODM’s solutions that really let you develop quickly and how mongoDB can be used to easily scale.

                        <p>
                            We, as developers, build software. A great part of this
software has command-line interfaces (CLI). As with any user
interfaces it is hard to get them right.

Fortunately, we have tools (such as optparse and argparse)
that help us to avoid burden associated with creating great
CLI. Or do they?

This presentation will show the drawbacks of those tools,
and present a better solution for creating beautiful
command-line apps in Python.

                            Jukka Lehtosalo - mypy: a Python variant with seamless dynamic and static typing
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Mypy is an experimental variant of Python that supports writing programs that seamlessly mix dynamic and static typing. Mypy aims to combine Java/C++-like scalability and efficiency to the power and convenience of Python, while keeping the dynamically typed subset of the language mostly compatible with Python.

In the presentation I am proposing I will give an informal overview of mypy and dynamic and static typing, and explain why having both dynamic and static typing in a programming language can be useful for Python developers. Static typing can, for example, make large development projects easier to maintain. I will also discuss what kinds of projects are likely to get the biggest benefits from static typing.

Finally, I will also contrast mypy with earlier projects with similar goals, such as PyPy and Cython.

Mypy is still in development, but I hope to be able to also give a short demo of a prototype implementation.

                            We all know that Python is a great programming language for beginners. Sadly, beginners in robotics are usually exposed to either difficult languages like C, or extremely simple drag'n'drop languages.

This talk will look at possibilities of using Python with popular Lego NXT platform. It will also introduce the nxtIDE project which allows you to program these robots in Python and also emulate them. This way you don't even need a physical robots to play with them. You just need a computer which can interpret Python!

                            Don't you love Python more than any other language? Isn't it true that your life would not be the same without Python? It's time to give back by contributing to Python itself!

CPython is the default Python interpreter, originally written by Guido van Rossum, and currently developed by a few dozen active core developers and hundreds of contributors from all over the world.

The CPython core consists of the interpreter and standard library. Roughly half of it is written in C and the other half in Python itself. There's also lots of test code, mostly written in Python, and thousands and thousands of lines of documentation that needs constant attention, too!

                            is a widely used generic test automation framework implemented in Python. The core development team of the framework itself is based in Finland and organizes this hacking sprint and helping clinic.

The main target of the sprint is helping anyone interested in enhancing Robot Framework or any of the tools/libraries in its ecosystem to get started. In addition to that, we can provide hands-on help for Robot Framework users, answer questions, and so on. Just meeting Robot Framework users in-real-life would also be cool.

            <p>
      All delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at PyCon Finland are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
<h2>
IN SHORT
</h2>
<p>
PyCon Finland is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
<p>
All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
<p>
Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

<h2>
LONGER VERSION
</h2>

<p>
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
<p>
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
<p>
Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
<p>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
<p>
We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

            Machine Learning with Python - from Model to Web-Service
        </a> by Aleksei Tiulpin
    </h3>
    <p>
      The presentation will describe the basic principles of machine learning:
      features, cross-validation and powerful, but simple algorithm - Random
      Forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The participants will learn basic pipeline for solving a simple pattern
      recognition problem, tools and libraries which are nowadays used by data
      scientists worldwide and they will also learn how to deploy their

                Representation Learning and Deep Sequential Modeling for
                Predicting Topics of Sentences in Job Advertisements
        </a> by Clemens Westrup
    </h3>
    <p>
    Recent advances in Machine Learning, specifically in Deep Learning have
    led to a popularization of this discipline beyond research and even into
    mainstream media. Approaches using Deep Learning and the so-called area of
    Representation Learning are now being applied to various areas of science
    and engineering and an active open source developer community has evolved
    around them pushing the limits of these algorithms and making them widely
    available and applicable for everyone. 
    </p><p>
    In this talk we will look at some of the latest developments using these
    techniques in the context of Natural Language Processing, in particular
    looking at the problem of text classification. A special emphasis will be
    placed on open source tools and libraries in Python that allow cutting
    edge research while allowing for fast, iterative and explorative research.
    </p>

        <a href="#talks-data-scraping" class="pagelink">
            Data scraping for beginners
        </a> by Juha-Matti Santala
    </h3>
    <p>The Internet is full of data but it's not always easily obtainable in
    a format that is analyzable or presented in an optimal way. Data scraping
    - pulling data from websites - gives you access to a whole new world of
      working with data.</p>
    <p>
      In my talk I'll go through the basics of data scraping in Python using a
      popular BeautifulSoup library.
    </p>
    <p><strong>About the author:</strong>Juha-Matti Santala is a full-stack
    web developer, community manager and education enthusiast who has worked
    as a developer in startups both in Silicon Valley and in Helsinki. Now he
    works as a community manager in Boost Turku helping young entrepreneurs
    with their ventures.

        <a href="#testing-webapps" class="pagelink">
                Testing webapps without ids or xpaths
        </a> by Pekka Kiviniemi
    </h3>
    <p>
        When web applications are created with development frameworks, UI
        element id tags are also generated. Id tags are widely considered the
        best way to refer to element but these new tags do not show purpose of
        the element. Because tags are generated, they can change without
        warning. That can ruin test automation business case due to laborious
        maintenance.</p>
    <p>
        I will show how to write understandable and maintainable test
        automation scripts by finding elements based on their labels or
        captions. I will also tell how web applications UI should be designed
        to support this method.
       </p>
    <p><strong>About the author:</strong>Pekka Kiviniemi is a test automation
    quality consultant at Qentinel. In his recent projects he has developed
    test automation for web applications using Selenium and Robot Framework.

            Attack of Pythons : Gotchas and Landmines in Python
        </a> by Manoj Pandey [unconfirmed]
    </h3>
    <p>
    Python may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages
    out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax,
    datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python ""warts"" are things
    for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language
        or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either
        expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions,
        or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.
        </p><p>
        This talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that
        people face using Python programming language.
    </p>
    <p><strong>About the author:</strong>Manoj Pandey is a rising CS junior, who
    speaks Python primarily and worked with SquadRun's Engineering Team this
    summer. Before this he was a Data Analytics Intern at Inspiration Edge and
    Zouk Fellow at ZoukLoans.     
    
    He is an avid FOSS enthusiast and Pythonista, almost all of his projects
    are open-sourced on Github (manojpandey).

            Visualizing twitter discussions with networkx
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>Every day, millions of people use social media like Twitter or
    Facebook, to catch up on news and engage in discussions with other users.
    Our research group at Aalto University analyzes such discussions and
    studies how people interact on social media. Towards this end,
    visualization can be a very useful tool.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we use networkx, a python library, to process and visualize
    user interactions on Twitter. We introduce networkx with simple examples
    and continue with the visualization of twitter data. During the talk,
    we’ll see that discussions about polarized topics (e.g., elections) look
    quite different than non-polarised ones."

            ZODB – the Python database
        </a> by Asko Soukka
    </h3>
    <p>
    ZODB is a mature and well maintained object-oriented database for
    transparently and persistently storing Python object trees (objects and
    their references). In other words, ZODB stores Python objects as they are
    – no object-relational mapping required. In addition to Python objects,
    ZODB can also store binary blobs (like images) attached to those objects.
    </p><p>
    I give a small tutorial on getting started with ZODB with a simple
    command-line app written in Python 3. I cover the basic ZODB usage,
    testing and maintenance. Finally, I give a short overview of the ZODB
    ecosystem and demo of SubstanceD – a ZODB embracing web app framework.

    <p><strong>About the author:</strong>Asko Soukka is a system designer
    at University of Jyväskylä and a core contributor for Plone - an open
    source CMS written in Python. He has have over 10 years of experience in
    using ZODB in CMS context with databases up to 100 GB.

        Unit testing in the Scientific Python stack
        </a> by Antti Kaihola
    </h3>
    <p>
        Writing unit tests for algorithms and data processing pipelines poses
        challenges distinct from those in the web or desktop application
        domain. A key reason for poor unit test coverage is that writing tests
        is hard and laborious.</p>
        <p>
        In this talk, I'll show some real-life unit test scenarios from Eniram
        along with tools we have developed to ease writing good tests. Many of
        the presented techniques also apply in other domains besides data
        processing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Topics will include some or all of:
        <ul>

            Lowering the bar with TLS adoption
        </a> by Joona Hoikkala
    </h3>
    <p>
    How EFF's Let's Encrypt client Certbot is addressing the issues with skill
    and effort needed in effective, secure TLS adoption and the sysadmin
    overhead of keeping the certificates and configuration up to date.
    </p><p>

    In this talk I'll be going over the philosophy behind Certbot client, it's
    role in the progression of web technologies in paraller with Let's Encrypt
    project (and possibly upcoming ACME protocol  support by other CAs).
    It's centered around Certbot internals, while touching subjects like
    configuration management using Python (Apache / Nginx), ACME protocol
    integration, release management from security perspective - leveraging
    PyPI, pip version pinning, and hash checking mode.

            FP in Python: it's simpler than you thought
        </a> by Dmitry Dolgov
    </h3>
    <p>
    Functional programming is a quite popular paradigm nowadays, but it
    suffers from a lot of myths and misunderstandings around it. And one of
    them is that functional programming can be applied only in few special
    languages, which is wrong. This paradigm is just a language agnostic way
    of thinking about your code. We will discuss pros and cons of applying it
    in case of Python:
    <ul>
    <li> Why do anyone need this at all?</li>
    <li>Since Python is a multi-paradigm language, what it already can
    provide</li>
    <li>for FP?</li>
    <li>Third-party libraries for FP in Python</li>
    </ul>

        <a href="#talks-solid-data-structures-in-python-with-logs" class="pagelink">
                Keynote: Jyrki Pulliainen - Solid data structures in Python with logs
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        We all know the classic web application that has a database connected to it. Over time the app grows and we add more bells and whistles, like a search functionality via ElasticSearch. Soon we notice that we need a cache too. 
        </p><p>
Now we have a fairly complex application and a completely new set of problems like the cache invalidation, stale data, consistency issues etc.

        </p><p>
What if I said that using logs would help you here? This talk looks into using Kafka via Python to build solid data structures.

        </p><p>
Overview of the talk outline is:
<ul>
    <li>Description of the problem</li>
    <li>What are log based data structures</li>
    <li>What's Kafka and why is it amazing?</li>
    <li>Using Kafka via Python</li>
    <li>Demo time!</li>
</ul>

        <a href="#talks-pragmatic-testing" class="pagelink">
                Charlie Hornsby - Pragmatic Testing
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I would like to talk about software testing from a real world point of view, explaining a healthy testing mindset for all programming skill levels. Just as programming skill is a continuum of experience, testing best practices are also not black and white. I will begin with a brief introduction to some testing concepts (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, etc) but the main focus of the presentation will be on ways for both professional developers and hobbyist programmers to improve their use of testing in everyday life.

                Igor Davydenko - Welcome to async/await era
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        PEP492 accepted and Python 3.5 will have new async/await statements. Talk will introduce them to the audience and shows examples on how to and when to use.
        </p><p>
Talk also covers how async/await helps to write better and clear asyncio web applications on top of aiohttp library and shows common patterns to use, while making backend applications on Python 3.5.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>About the author:</strong> Python &amp; React.js developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. Love creating API for humans, open source libraries, and giving talks about the process. In Python 3 &amp; asyncio I trust.

                Elena Oat - Building a marketplace
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Motivation for this talk is sharing my own experience with implementing Stripe payments in a Django application. I will, specifically, touch on Stripe Connect which is meant for marketplaces. Django is still missing a package for this purpose.
        <p></p>
The talk will include challenges faced and some of the solutions.

                Priidu Kull - Weaving a Search Engine around User's Workflow
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        In this talk I will discuss my attempt to build a search engine for legal documents that lawyers would love to use. I tried to figure out how lawyers work with documents and to build a search engine that would best fit their workflows. I will discuss the methods that I have used for finding out about their workflows and the decisions that I had to make to best accommodate the workflows of my users. The talk will include practical advice on using Elasticsearch.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>About the author:</strong> I was a lawyer, then decided to become a coder because I enjoyed coding so much and I was motivated by the ability to make a difference that coders possess more than lawyers. Currently I have three years of experience in software development, including 1.5 years working for a software development firm. The project that will feature in my talk is online at <a href="http://legal.ee/">http://legal.ee/</a> and I am currently putting in full time effort to develop it.

                Matteo Cafasso - Hunting Malware with Python
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Worms, Trojans, BotNets and Ransomware. These bad guys are quite known nowadays but how do they look like?
        </p><p>
I am gonna show one of the approaches IT Security experts employ to study these threats using open source Python technologies.
</p><p>
The presentation would be a live demo in which I'll execute some malware in a secure environment and show how it behaves and how to detect it.
</p><p>
I will show a Sandboxing technology developed within F-Secure named Sandboxed Execution Environment (SEE). SEE is a Python framework which allows to quickly build behavioural scanning engines.
</p><p>
SEE will be used altogether with other open source technologies to show some recent malware to the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>About the author:</strong> I am a software engineer working in F-Secure Labs. F-Secure Corporation is an IT security company based in Helsinki. 
        </p><p>
Among my duties, malware handling and analysis automation is one of the most interesting to me.
</p><p>
I develop and maintain the main behavioural scanning engines within F-Secure back-end and SEE is one of their core technology.

        <a href="#talks-introducing-the-asphalt-framework" class="pagelink">
                Alex Grönholm - Introducing the Asphalt framework
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Most existing server frameworks only cater to a specific network protocol, forcing developers to learn everything anew when building an app for a different protocol. Or worse, there's no framework available so they have to reinvent everything by themselves.
        </p><p>
Now, meet Asphalt -- a new general purpose server microframework that not only solves these problems, but also provides strong compatibility guarantees through the use of semantic versioning and PEP 484 type hints.
</p><p>
In this talk, you will hear how Asphalt compares (or doesn't) to Twisted, how to mix asynchronous code with synchronous code and how to develop multi-protocol applications that work seamlessly together.
    </p>

        <strong>About the author:</strong> I'm a private contractor from Espoo, 35 years old. I'm a Jython core developer and the author of APScheduler, sqlacodegen, jython-swingutils, the concurrent.futures backport and of course the Asphalt framework.

        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I would like to introduce and expand the ideas presented by Adam Tornhil in his work (Your Code as a Crime Scene – applying forensics to mining software repositories - where do the bugs propbably lurch). Tornhill's main ideas are combining cyclomatic code complexity metric with repository history -calculated "code/knowledge ownership". Adding test coverage data, replicated production-system web traffic and their call graphs adds whole new dimensions to the data available from the repository.

                Asko Soukka - Nix for Python developers
        </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
        What do you do when your python project has dependencies beyond Python? Nix is a "purely functional" package manager, which can also be used like "virtualenv", but for everything. I would cover single user installation of Nix package manager on Linux or Mac, defining Nix based development environments, generating Nix expressions for large Python projects using buildout, and finally, building minimal Docker images from SCRATCH by using those generated expressions.
